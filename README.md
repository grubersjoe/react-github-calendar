## FAQ

### Is server side rendering (SSR) supported?

Yes. However, not with this component because it fetches data client-side. For SSR support, you can
fetch the GitHub contribution data from a suitable
[API](https://github.com/grubersjoe/github-contributions-api) server-side and pass it on to the
internally used [`react-activity-calendar`](https://github.com/grubersjoe/react-activity-calendar)
component. See the
[source code](https://github.com/grubersjoe/react-github-calendar/blob/main/src/index.tsx) for the
GitHub color theme.

### Why is Create React App unsupported?

Create React App (CRA) is considered
[abandoned](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/discussions/11086), and you probably should
not use it anymore (more
[background](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/issues/11180#issuecomment-874748552)).
Using this component inside CRA will lead to errors for reasons described in issue
[#105](https://github.com/grubersjoe/react-activity-calendar/issues/105) of
`react-activity-calendar`. This repo is not for CRA support questions. If you encounter issues, you
need to fix those yourself given the maintenance state of CRA. Personally, I would recommend using
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) instead of CRA.
